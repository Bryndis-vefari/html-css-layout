# About me page
---
This assignment is my first attemtp at coding. I made a simple about me page that I plan to continue working on and link up to a portfolio website. I learned a lot doing this, the basics of html and css and how they work together as well as setting up the work environment needed for coding, with Git, VScode and GitHub.
